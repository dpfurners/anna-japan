Anna, my heart,

Today I explored the Tokyo Gardens and found a quiet spot with cherry blossoms. I sat there for almost an hour just writing in my journal about us. An elderly Japanese couple sat nearby and smiled at me. The woman spoke a little English and asked if I was writing to someone special. When I told her about you, she said, "Love crosses oceans" in the most beautiful accent.

I've been taking photos of everything to show you, but they don't capture the feeling of being here. The way the light filters through the trees reminds me of how sunlight catches in your hair.

Tonight I'm treating myself to ramen at a tiny local shop my host recommended. I'll be imagining you sitting across from me at the counter, laughing as I struggle with chopsticks.

I love you more with every passing minute.

Forever yours,
Daniel
