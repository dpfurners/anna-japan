  Sugar pie, honey bunch
  You know that I love you
  I can't help myself
  I love you and nobody else

My dear Anna,

Tonight is our last night together before I board that plane. My bags are packed, but my heart is so full of you. I've been thinking about all the pictures I'll take to share with you, and all the stories I'll write for you.

I can't believe we'll be apart for three months, but I promise every day I'll find a way to make you smile from across the world. Maybe tonight we can make a little time capsule of memories to open when I return?

I love you more than words can say.

Forever yours,
Daniel
