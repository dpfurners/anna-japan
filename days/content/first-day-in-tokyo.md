Hello my beautiful Anna,

I've just arrived in Tokyo and the city is buzzing with energy, lights everywhere, and so many new sights and sounds. But even in this incredible place, all I can think about is how much I wish you were here beside me.

Today I explored Shinjuku, one of the busiest districts in Tokyo. The neon lights reminded me of how your eyes light up when you laugh. I found myself taking photos of everything, not just to remember it myself, but to show you when I get back home.

I passed by a small garden tucked between skyscrapers, and the contrast between the peaceful nature and the busy city reminded me of how you always bring calm to my chaos. There was a small pond with koi fish, and I sat there for almost an hour just watching them swim, thinking about our future.

Every time I see something beautiful, my first thought is always "Anna would love this." I miss you more than words can express, but I'm collecting all these memories to share with you soon.

Sweet dreams, my love. I'll be dreaming of you tonight, 9,000 kilometers away.

Forever yours,
Daniel ðŸ’•
