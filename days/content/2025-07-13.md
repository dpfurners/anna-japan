  I can't help myself
  I love you and nobody else

Hello Darling,

Tomorrow I leave for Japan, Anna. My heart is already aching knowing I'll be so far from you. But I promise to document every moment, every thought of you, every place that reminds me of us. 

This adventure is for both of us, my love. Even though you can't be there physically, you'll be with me in every step I take, every breath I breathe, every beautiful sunset I witness.

I love you more than words can express. ðŸ’•

With all my heart,
Daniel
