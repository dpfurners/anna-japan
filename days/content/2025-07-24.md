  I found a love for me
  Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
  Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
  Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

My dearest Anna,

First day in Tokyo and I'm completely overwhelmed by everything - the lights, the sounds, the crowds. Everything is so different here, but all I can think about is you and how much I wish you could experience this with me.

I saw a couple today holding hands in Shibuya Crossing (the famous intersection with thousands of people crossing at once), and it made me reach for your hand that wasn't there.

I bought you a small cherry blossom keychain from a local artisan. It's the first of many treasures I'll bring home to you. I'll keep it safe until we're together again.

The time difference is tough - when I'm waking up, you're going to sleep. But I like thinking that we're looking at the same stars, just at different times.

Loving you from across the world,
Daniel
